# Project Overview
  
  ## Main Purpose and Functionality
  
  The code defines a system for managing and applying discounts to items, potentially within a shopping cart or order processing system. It allows for different types of discounts (fixed amount, percentage) and provides mechanisms for validating and applying these discounts to items.
  
  ## High-level Architecture/Design Patterns
  
  The code utilizes an object-oriented approach, employing classes to represent different discount types and their associated logic. This promotes modularity and extensibility. The design pattern used is likely a Strategy pattern, where different discount types are strategies that can be applied to an item.
  
  ## Key Features
  
  *   **Discount Types:** Supports fixed amount and percentage-based discounts.
  *   **Discount Validation:** Includes a mechanism to check if a discount is valid (e.g., not expired).
  *   **Discount Application:** Provides methods to apply discounts to items and calculate the discounted price.
  *   **Extensibility:** Designed to easily accommodate new discount types in the future.

  ## Class `Discount`
  
  *   **Inheritance:** Base class (abstract) for all discount types.
  *   **Purpose and Responsibilities:** Defines the common interface and basic functionality for all discounts.
  *   **Class Attributes:**
      *   `value` (float): The discount value (amount or percentage).
      *   `valid_until` (datetime): The date and time until which the discount is valid.
  *   **Methods:**
  
      *   `__init__(self, value: float, valid_until: datetime)`:
          *   Parameters:
              *   `value`: The discount value.
              *   `valid_until`: The datetime object representing the discount's expiration date.
          *   Return Value: None
          *   Side Effects: Initializes the `value` and `valid_until` attributes.
  
      *   `is_valid(self) -> bool`:
          *   Parameters: None
          *   Return Value: `True` if the current date and time is before `valid_until`, `False` otherwise.
          *   Side Effects: None
  
      *   `apply_discount(self, item_price: float) -> float`:
          *   Parameters:
              *   `item_price`: The original price of the item.
          *   Return Value: The discounted price of the item.
          *   Side Effects: None
          *   Note: This is an abstract method and must be implemented by subclasses.
  
  ## Class `FixedDiscount`
  
  *   **Inheritance:** Inherits from `Discount`.
  *   **Purpose and Responsibilities:** Represents a fixed amount discount.
  *   **Class Attributes:** Inherits attributes from `Discount`.
  *   **Methods:**
  
      *   `apply_discount(self, item_price: float) -> float`:
          *   Parameters:
              *   `item_price`: The original price of the item.
          *   Return Value: The item price minus the discount `value`, or 0 if the discount is greater than the item price.
          *   Side Effects: None
          *   Usage Example:
              ```
  python
              # Assuming FixedDiscount object 'discount' with value 10 and valid_until in the future
              discounted_price = discount.apply_discount(25.0)  # Returns 15.0
              discounted_price = discount.apply_discount(5.0)  # Returns 0.0
              
  ```
  
  ## Class `PercentageDiscount`
  
  *   **Inheritance:** Inherits from `Discount`.
  *   **Purpose and Responsibilities:** Represents a percentage-based discount.
  *   **Class Attributes:** Inherits attributes from `Discount`.
  *   **Methods:**
  
      *   `apply_discount(self, item_price: float) -> float`:
          *   Parameters:
              *   `item_price`: The original price of the item.
          *   Return Value: The item price reduced by the specified percentage.
          *   Side Effects: None
          *   Usage Example:
              ```
  python
              # Assuming PercentageDiscount object 'discount' with value 20 and valid_until in the future
              discounted_price = discount.apply_discount(100.0)  # Returns 80.0
              
  ```
  
  ## Function `apply_discount_to_item(item: dict, discount: Discount) -> dict`
  
  *   **Signature:** `apply_discount_to_item(item: dict, discount: Discount) -> dict`
  *   **Purpose:** Applies a given discount to an item and returns a new dictionary with the updated price.
  *   **Parameters:**
      *   `item`: A dictionary representing the item, with keys "name" (str) and "price" (float).
      *   `discount`: A `Discount` object (or one of its subclasses).
  *   **Return Value:** A new dictionary with the same "name" as the input item and a "price" key reflecting the discounted price.
  *   **Examples:**
  
      ```
  python
      from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  
      item = {"name": "Example Item", "price": 50.0}
      fixed_discount = FixedDiscount(10.0, datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))
      discounted_item = apply_discount_to_item(item, fixed_discount)
      print(discounted_item)  # Expected output: {'name': 'Example Item', 'price': 40.0}
  
      percentage_discount = PercentageDiscount(25.0, datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))
      discounted_item = apply_discount_to_item(item, percentage_discount)
      print(discounted_item)  # Expected output: {'name': 'Example Item', 'price': 37.5}
      
  ```
  *   **Exceptions Raised:** None explicitly, but the function assumes the input `item` dictionary has "name" and "price" keys.
  
  # Dependencies
  
  *   **Required External Packages:**
      *   `datetime` (built-in Python module)
  *   **System Requirements:** None specified.
  
  # Implementation Details
  
  ## Key Algorithms
  
  *   **Discount Application:** The core logic resides in the `apply_discount` methods of the `Discount` subclasses. These methods implement the specific discount calculation based on the discount type.
  *   **Validation:** The `is_valid` method checks the discount's validity against the current date and time.
  
  ## Important Design Decisions
  
  *   **Abstract Base Class:** The use of an abstract base class (`Discount`) allows for easy extension with new discount types.
  *   **Object-Oriented Structure:** The class-based design promotes code reusability and maintainability.
  *   **Immutability of Item:** The `apply_discount_to_item` function returns a *new* item dictionary, leaving the original item unchanged.
  
  ## Performance Considerations
  
  *   The code is generally efficient for typical use cases. The calculations involved are simple arithmetic operations.
  *   For extremely large numbers of items or discounts, performance could be optimized, but this is unlikely to be a bottleneck in most scenarios.
  
  ## Threading/Async Behavior
  
  *   None. The code is synchronous.
  
  # Usage Guide
  
  ## Installation Instructions
  
  *   No external packages need to be installed. The code uses only built-in Python modules.
  
  ## Configuration Requirements
  
  *   None.
  
  ## Code Examples for Common Use Cases
  
  ```
  python
  from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  
  # Create a fixed discount
  fixed_discount = FixedDiscount(5.0, datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))
  
  # Create a percentage discount
  percentage_discount = PercentageDiscount(10.0, datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=12))
  
  # Create an item
  item = {"name": "Shirt", "price": 20.0}
  
  # Apply the fixed discount
  discounted_item1 = apply_discount_to_item(item, fixed_discount)
  print(f"Discounted item (fixed): {discounted_item1}")
  
  # Apply the percentage discount
  discounted_item2 = apply_discount_to_item(item, percentage_discount)
  print(f"Discounted item (percentage): {discounted_item2}")
  
  # Check if a discount is valid
  print(f"Fixed discount is valid: {fixed_discount.is_valid()}")
  print(f"Percentage discount is valid: {percentage_discount.is_valid()}")
  
  # Example with an expired discount
  expired_discount = FixedDiscount(5.0, datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1))
  print(f"Expired discount is valid: {expired_discount.is_valid()}")
  discounted_item3 = apply_discount_to_item(item, expired_discount)
  print(f"Discounted item (expired): {discounted_item3}") # price will not change
  
  
  ```
  
  ## Best Practices
  
  *   Always check the validity of a discount before applying it.
  *   Consider using a more robust date/time library (e.g., `pendulum`) for complex date/time manipulations.
  *   For a large number of discount types, consider using a factory pattern to create discount instances.
  
  # Notes and Warnings
  
  ## Known Limitations
  
  *   The code only handles two discount types (fixed and percentage).
  *   The `apply_discount_to_item` function assumes a specific structure for the item dictionary.
  
  ## Common Pitfalls
  
  *   Forgetting to check discount validity before application.
  *   Incorrectly handling date/time comparisons.
  
  ## Security Considerations
  
  *   None in the provided code. However, if discount values or item data are sourced from user input, appropriate sanitization and validation should be implemented to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
