# Project Overview

- **Main Purpose and Functionality:** The code defines a function that converts a base-10 integer to its equivalent representation in base-26, where each digit is represented by an uppercase letter (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
- **High-level Architecture/Design Patterns:** The code uses a simple iterative algorithm for the base conversion. It doesn't employ any specific design patterns.
- **Key Features:**
    - Converts a non-negative integer to a base-26 string.
    - Uses uppercase letters A-Z to represent digits.

## Functions

- **Function Signature:** `to_base26(n: int) -> str`
- **Purpose:** Converts a non-negative integer `n` to its base-26 representation.
- **Parameters:**
    - `n` (int): The non-negative integer to convert.
- **Return Value:**
    - `str`: The base-26 representation of `n` as a string.
- **Examples:**

    ```python
    print(to_base26(0))  # Output: A
    print(to_base26(25)) # Output: Z
    print(to_base26(26)) # Output: BA
    print(to_base26(51)) # Output: BZ
    print(to_base26(52)) # Output: CA
    print(to_base26(701)) # Output: ZZ
    print(to_base26(702)) # Output: AAA
    ```
- **Exceptions Raised:** The provided code does not explicitly handle any exceptions, but it implicitly assumes the input is a non-negative integer. Providing a negative integer will lead to incorrect output.

# Dependencies

- **Required External Packages:** None
- **System Requirements:**  Python 3

# Implementation Details

- **Key Algorithms:**
    The core algorithm is an iterative base conversion.  It repeatedly performs the following steps:
    1. Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 26. This remainder corresponds to the rightmost digit in the base-26 representation.
    2. Convert the remainder to its corresponding uppercase letter (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25) using `chr(ord('A') + remainder)`.
    3. Prepend this letter to the result string.
    4. Update `n` by integer division by 26 (`n //= 26`).
    5. Repeat until `n` becomes 0.

- **Important Design Decisions:**
    - The use of `chr(ord('A') + remainder)` efficiently converts the numerical remainder to its letter representation.
    - The iterative approach avoids recursion, which could be less efficient for very large numbers.
    - Prepending to the result string builds the base-26 representation from right to left.

- **Performance Considerations:**
    - The algorithm's time complexity is O(log<sub>26</sub>(n)), where n is the input integer. The number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in the base-26 representation.
    - String concatenation in Python can be inefficient if done repeatedly. However, since the number of digits is usually relatively small, the performance impact is negligible.

- **Threading/Async Behavior:** None

# Usage Guide

- **Installation Instructions:**
    No specific installation is required. The code is a single function and can be directly copied and used.

- **Configuration Requirements:** None

- **Code Examples for Common Use Cases:**

    ```python
    def to_base26(n: int) -> str:
        result = ''
        while n >= 0:
            remainder = n % 26
            result = chr(ord('A') + remainder) + result
            n = n // 26 - 1
            if n == -1:
                break
        return result

    # Convert a number to base-26
    number = 702
    base26_string = to_base26(number)
    print(f"The base-26 representation of {number} is {base26_string}")

    number = 27
    base26_string = to_base26(number)
    print(f"The base-26 representation of {number} is {base26_string}")
    ```

- **Best Practices:**
    - Ensure the input is a non-negative integer.
